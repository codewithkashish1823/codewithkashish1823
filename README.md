# CSS Selectors Practice Project

This is a simple front-end project to practice and demonstrate the use of various CSS selectors like class, ID, descendant, child, and combined selectors.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Uses `stylesheet.css` to show CSS specificity and class combinations.
- `combine.css.selector.html`: Contains elements styled with combined CSS selectors from `style.css`.
- `stylesheet.css`: Contains styles for nested boxes, colored text, and padding.
- `style.css`: Demonstrates advanced selector use like `.box > p`, `li.done`, `ul p.done`, etc.

## What I Learned

- How to apply CSS using external stylesheets.
- The difference between element, class, ID, and combined selectors.
- How nesting and specificity affect styling.

## Preview

To view the project, just open the HTML files in any browser.
